* What's new
**************************************************

******************************
* 0.2.16
******************************
  - Subproject "System-builtin Headers for ILE RPG" is renamed to "System-builtin Headers and Examples for ILE HLLs". The subproject is enriched with system-builtin headers for ILE COBOL and usage examples in ILE COBOL and CL of using system-builtins (bound program access interfaces of MI instructions). Also the original system-builtin headers for ILE RPG, mih52.rpgleinc, and mih54.rpgleinc are divided into small ones by category. Please refere to System-builtin Headers and Examples for ILE HLLs for details. The page List of System-builtins lists all system-builtins currently covered by this subproject.
 - CL command Display Panel (DSPPNL) is added to UIM Related Tools
 - The CVTHC Program is added to Miscellaneous Tools which is handy for an OPM or ILE HLL program to convert a hexadecimal value to character format.
 - New techtips and how-tos added to subproject Space Object Tools
 - Binary components (save files) in directory bin of the release packaged changed:
   - SAVF bin/emi.savf is removed
   - SAVF bin/rpg.savf is removed
   - SAVF bin/ifs.savf is added. IFS directories saved in it are:
     - /usr/local/include/cobol
     - /usr/local/include/emi
     - /usr/local/include/rpg
     - /usr/local/bin/i5toolkit

******************************
* 0.2.14
******************************
New components and utilities provided by the release include:
 - Software Configuration Management Tools for i5/OS
 - ILE RPG Header for User Interface Manager (UIM) APIs 

******************************
* 0.2.13
******************************
 - ILE RPG header for the SEPT added.
 - More than thirty ILE RPG protoypes for i5/OS system builtins added
   to rpg/mih52.rpgleinc and rpg/mih54.rpgleinc.
 - Binary components (save files) in directory bin of the release packaged changed:
   - SAVF bin/emi_inc.savf is removed.
   - SAVF bin/emi.savf added in which IFS dir /usr/local/include/emi are saved.
   - SAVF bin/rpg.savf added in which IFS dir /usr/local/include/rpg are saved.

**************************************************
* Installation Guide
**************************************************
To install i5/OS Programmer's Toolkit on your IBM i box, you need
only to restore the precompiled components to your machine, and
then optionally compile and run CL program INSTALL in order to
create symbol links for MIC's QShell commands.

To run CL program INSTALL, you need to compile it from source
member I5TOOLKIT/CLSRC(INSTALL).

The precompiled components are placed in *SAVFILE bin/i5toolkit.savf,
which is saved from a V5R2 box.

Command to restore library I5TOOLKIT
 - RSTLIB SAVLIB(I5TOOLKIT) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(LSBIN/I5TOOLKIT)

Command to restore EMI includes
 - RST DEV('/qsys.lib/some_lib.lib/ifs.file') OBJ('/usr/local/include/emi')
   * chnage 'some_lib' to the library name where you uploaded *SAVF bin/ifs.savf to.
   * if IFS directory /usr/local/include does not already exist, create it using
     CL command CRTDIR or qshell command mkdir before restoring *SAVF ifs.

Command to restore system-builtin headers for ILE HLLs
 - RST DEV('/qsys.lib/some_lib.lib/ifs.file') OBJ('/usr/local/include/*')
   * chnage 'some_lib' to the library name where you uploaded *SAVF bin/ifs.savf to.
   * if IFS directory /usr/local/include does not already exist, create it using
     CL command CRTDIR or qshell command mkdir before restoring *SAVF ifs.
